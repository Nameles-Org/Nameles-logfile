# Nameles

### First ever open source solution for detecting invalid traffic (ad fraud)

Nameles is an entropy based open source ad fraud detection solution that detects traffic anomalies agnostically across desktop and mobile. It has been proven[1] to deliver excellent results in detecting banner, video and app fraud at large scale with minimal Total-Cost-of-Ownership.

The core developer of the project is Antonio Pastor (@apastor). Other major contributors include: 

- Patricia Callejo
- Arturo Azcorra
- Ruben Cuevas
- Angel Cuevas
- Matti Parssinen
- Amit Phansalkar 
- Mikko Kotila

And last but not least, the Master himself, RR. Alan Turing of our time.
